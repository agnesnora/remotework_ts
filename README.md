# My First TypeScript React Navbar Project

Welcome to my first TypeScript React project!

## Introduction

This project is my very first experience using TypeScript in which I am aiming to build a reusable Navbar component and craft a responsive website. The project also marks my initial exploration into testing with Jest for React code. While diving into the world of TypeScript and React, I took on the challenge of incorporating Jest for testing, which brought its own set of challenges. One of the significant hurdles was setting up a seamless environment where Vite, TypeScript, and Jest could seamlessly work together.

## Project Overview

The project currently features:

- A Navbar component with a sandwich menu icon.
- Two dropdown buttons with lists of links.
- The buttons are clickable, but they don't navigate anywhere for simplicity.

## Technologies Used

- TypeScript
- React
- SCSS
